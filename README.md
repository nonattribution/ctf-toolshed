# ctf-toolshed

This is just a collection of snippets and scripts from various sources. 
Much of it I did not right and ironically, I do not have attribution for it. 

In other words, i dont know where some of this came from . 
CTF writeups, tips, blog posts , various git repositories, etc. 

its only on github because I am using atom (editor)  and wanted to test the github integration in atom.
